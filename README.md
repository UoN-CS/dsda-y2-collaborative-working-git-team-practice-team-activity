# dsda-y2-collaborative-working-git-team-practice-team-activity

This is NOT a coding activity. By completing this activity, the team will gain practical experience with branching, merging, resolving conflicts, and integrating user interaction and data manipulation functionalities into their Python script. They will also reinforce the importance of teamwork and communication in collaborative software development while intentionally practising conflict resolution. 

# Clone this repository. 
You have the option to either:
Use your existing team repository for this task by adding the cloned files there. After completing the activity, you may delete these files if they are no longer needed.
OR create a new repository specifically for this task and add the files there.
Once youâ€™ve decided, push the files from the cloned repository to your chosen team repository.

# Goal:

-Practice branching, merging, and resolving conflicts in a collaborative environment using a modified main.py script.
-Understand the importance of clear communication and coordination for effective teamwork.
-Intentionally create merge conflicts to practice conflict resolution.

# Scenario:
The team is working on extending the main.py script from the previous exercise, adding functionalities for user interaction and data manipulation.

# Steps
1) Divide into pairs: Divide the team into three pairs.
2) Assign tasks: Assign each pair a specific feature to implement in main.py:

    - Pair 1: Modify the script to prompt the user for their age and greet them accordingly (e.g., "Hello, [user name]! Welcome!" for adults and "Hi, [user name]! How can I help you today?" for users under 18).
    - Pair 2: Add functionality for users to enter a number and display its square.
    - Pair 3: Implement a feature to save user greetings and display squares to a text file named log.txt.

3) Create branches: Each pair should create a new branch from the main branch to work on their assigned feature.

4) Implement features: Each pair should modify main.py to implement their feature and commit changes to their branch.

5) Push branches to the remote repository: Each pair should push their branch to the team's GitHub repository.

6) Merge branches: One team member should merge the branches into the main branch using good coding practices.

7) Resolve conflicts (if necessary): If merge conflicts occur (especially if multiple pairs modify the user interaction section), the team should work together to resolve them.

8) Review and test changes: The team should review the merged changes, test the script with different user inputs, and ensure the interaction and data-saving functionalities work as expected.
